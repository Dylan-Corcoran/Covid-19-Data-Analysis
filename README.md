- The aim of this project was to conduct some exploratory analysis into the Our World Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) data set. 
- This csv file contains 139,838 rows of information relating to Covid-19 instances, deaths, and vaccinations in each country worldwide. 

- First, the original file was split into two seperate data sets. This allowed for a more streamlined analysis of each and provided scope for a join to be performed
  later in the script. 

- Each file was then cleaned in order to prepare it for import into MySQLWorkbench.

- Once each file had been imported corretly, I performed various queries to extract the relevant information. Included in the queries were actions such as
  Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.

- Using the results of these queries, a Tableau dashboard was then created.
